/** @file
 *  @brief What a fiber records about itself while it is blocked.
 *
 * A blocked fiber's stack is parked in an mmap'd region no OS thread points at,
 * so neither `thread apply all bt` nor a core dump reaches the frames that
 * explain a hang. Each fiber therefore stores its wait kind, the object it
 * waits on, and its frame pointer. Unwinding from that frame pointer
 * reconstructs the parked backtrace, and happens only when a report is
 * requested.
 *
 * @see thread/introspect.h
 * @see doc/docs/guides/debugging-concurrency.md
