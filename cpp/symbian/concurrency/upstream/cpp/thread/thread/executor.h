/**
 * @brief A lock a parking scheduler drops for the duration of the park.
 *
 * A thread that has run a fiber carries a scheduler, which parks the thread
 * when no fiber is runnable. A host runtime uses this guard to release a global
 * lock around that park.
 *
 * `acquire` runs after `release` returns, on the same thread, whether the park
 * ended in a wake or a timeout. Both must tolerate being called on a thread
 * without the host lock; the CPython pair reads `PyGILState_Check()`. Install
 * the callbacks once, before fibers run. The callback interface keeps `thread`
 * independent of the host runtime.
