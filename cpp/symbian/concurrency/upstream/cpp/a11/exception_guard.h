/**
 * @file
 * @brief Turns what a caller's callable throws into a Status, at the boundary.
 *
 * A11 is compiled `-fno-exceptions` (see `a11_disallow_exceptions` in
 * cpp/CMakeLists.txt) and raises nothing of its own. A callable handed *in* by
 * a caller is the exception: it may come from C++ built with exceptions, or
 * from Python through pybind11, and it may throw. This is where that is dealt
 * with, and there are exactly two shapes.
 *
 * ## Wrap, for a callable A11 stores and calls later
 *
 * A `try` only protects a callable it invokes directly. An exception raised by
 * a callable that A11 invokes from one of its own frames would have to unwind
 * through that frame, and a `-fno-exceptions` frame has no cleanup information:
 * the destructors of its locals do not run and the behaviour is undefined. So a
 * helper of the shape
 *
 * exception_guard::Attempt([&] { on_message(message); }, "on_message");   //
 * WRONG here
 *
 * protects nothing when it sits in one of A11's own translation units -- the
 * lambda belongs to that unit, and the unit has no exceptions.
 *
 * `Wrap` instead returns a callable whose body was compiled *with* exceptions,
 * so at call time the stack reads
 *
 *     [A11, no exceptions] -> [the wrapper, exceptions, try] -> [the callable]
 *
 * and nothing unwinds through A11. Wrap once, where the callable is adopted --
 * where `on_message` is stored, where a codec is registered -- and every later
 * invocation is safe without another thought. This is the shape to use for
 * anything crossing A11's public API.
 *
 * ## Attempt, for a template in a header
 *
 * `Submit<T>` and `Future<T>::OnReady` cannot be wrapped that way: they are
 * templates, instantiated by whoever calls them, so there is no single
 * signature to pre-compile. For those, `Attempt` runs the callable in the frame
 * of the translation unit doing the instantiating, and catches only if that
 * unit has exceptions -- which is exactly the unit whose callable might throw.
 * Inside A11's own build it compiles to a plain call with no landing pad.
 *
 * The caveat, and it is why the public API prefers `Wrap`: if A11 and a caller
 * instantiate the same template with the same types, the linker keeps one of
 * the two bodies, and it may keep A11's. A callable handed to a template entry
 * point should therefore not rely on being caught. Anything type-erased --
 * `OnMessage`, an action handler, a registered codec -- is wrapped and carries
 * the guarantee.
 *
 * ## Adding a Wrap signature
 *
 * `Wrap` is declared here and defined in a11/internal/exception_guard_impl.h,
 * which only the per-library boundary translation units include --
 * `a11/data/boundary.cc` and its siblings, each named in the exception policy
 * block of cpp/CMakeLists.txt. Instantiating a signature there is what makes it
 * usable; forgetting to is a link error naming the exact signature, which is
 * the intended way to find out. The boundary unit belongs to the library that
 * owns the callable's type, so none of this inverts the dependency graph.
