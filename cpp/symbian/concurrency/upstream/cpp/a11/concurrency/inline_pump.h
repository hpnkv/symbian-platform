/**
 * @file
 * @brief
 *   Driving a state-machine pump on whichever thread asked it for something.
 *
 * A11's pumps -- the chunk store reader and writer, and anything else built the
 * same way -- run on whichever thread asks them for something, rather than only
 * on the worker pool. Waking a worker and waiting costs a scheduler hop to do
 * work the caller could do in the frame it is already in, and through a
 * language binding an event-loop turn on top of that.
 *
 * Completing work runs the caller's continuation, which may ask the pump for
 * more work and re-enter it. This helper bounds that re-entry.

/**
 * @brief
 *   Run @p once until the pump has nothing left to do without waiting.
 *
 * Recursion is bounded rather than forbidden: a call arriving over @p
 * max_depth asks the turns already running for another pass instead of adding
 * a frame. The cap counts *all* live drives, so a genuinely concurrent driver
 * can be turned away too. That costs it a pass it need not have made, which is
 * far cheaper than turning away every concurrent caller and handing its work
 * to whoever happens to be inside -- an inline drive exists precisely so that
 * a caller does its own work.
 *
 * Deciding to leave and dropping out of the count happen under one hold of
 * @p mu, and a call that is turned away sets `again` under the same lock, so
 * one of the two always observes the other and the requested pass is retained.
 * @p once is wrapped so an escaping exception cannot leak the count and strand
 * the pump.
 *
 * @param mu
 *   The pump's mutex, guarding @p state.
 * @param state
 *   The pump's re-entry bookkeeping.
 * @param name
 *   Pump name for the diagnostic when @p once raises.
 * @param once
 *   One turn of the state machine. Must not block.
 * @param max_depth
 *   How many live drives to allow before folding further calls into them.
